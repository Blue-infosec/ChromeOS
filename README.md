## Activities to perform on a Chrome OS device

1. Under settings > People > Sync

Turn sync off everything except for extensions and bookmarks. I find these two settings the least privacy intrusive to get up and running if you log into a chrome browser on another device.

Under encryption options ensure you are encrypting your data with a sync passphrase created by you and not your google chrome password.

### Important Flags for security

This is just a running list on enabling Linux Beta if your chrome os device supports it.
